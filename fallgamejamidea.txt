Fall Down Stairs
Idea 1

*Mechanics:
Life points, that you lose the longer you falling down the infinite stairs
Control your player to move left and right along the staircase to pick up bandages that get increasingly
farther apart
you try to fall further down the stairs each time by buying Upgrades:
-you can get more life points
-you can reduce the rate at which you lose life points (defense)
-increase fall speed(aerodynamics, rotundness) so you get farther before you die

*Buying Upgrades (currency)

*Chance:
Bouncy stair - Bouncy stairs will appear and if you hit them you will bounce high off the stairs and 
not lose life points while in the air
gamble for upgrades
